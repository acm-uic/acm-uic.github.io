- [Chase](infrastructure/servers/chase)
- [Lee](infrastructure/servers/lee)
- [Miku](infrastructure/servers/miku)

The 3 servers that are in the process of deploying to production are

- [Mikrotik Rose](https://mikrotik.com/product/rds2216)
- Roxy (Dell Poweredge R620)
- Eris (Dell Poweredge R510)

The networking for the whole rack (and more) is managed by 2 pfSense routers in:

- Ackem (Dell Poweredge 1950)
- Littlebell (Dell Poweredge 1950)

  I really need to know the hardware specs for the Dell Poweredges
  Also make documentations for the routers (pfSense is a must. Ehhh on the Ubiquiti stuff)
