# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation pages for ACM. Mainly, we are keeping 2 types of documentations:

- [Infrastructure](Infrastructure/About.md): which are holding the current information about the organization's servers
- [kb](kb/Overview.md): The wisdom of individuals and/or groups that they are willing to share. (Mostly outdated nowadays, but you can change that by contributing!!!)

Join ACM to find out how you can volunteer to help!
