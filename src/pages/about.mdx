# About

The Association for Computing Machinery Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Chicago (ACM@UIC) is a community for all UIC students interested in computing, computing machinery and related technologies. ACM@UIC members engage in computing-related social and educational activities. Additionally, members are encouraged to provide computing resources and assistance to members and non-members alike. Above all, the driving force behind ACM@UIC is its students' insatiable desire to understand and contribute to the computing technology around us. It is this desire which drives us to excel and keeps this organization fun.

ACM@UIC also can function as a means of communication between the CS department and its students. We host and participate in events which help keep the UIC techie community close, including LAN parties, lectures by guest speakers, company presentations, activities with other tech related clubs and an office to hang out in and talk or study adjacent to the cs lounge on the second floor of SELE on campus. Our <DiscordLink>Discord server</DiscordLink> and <SlackSignUpLink>Slack Workspace</SlackSignUpLink> also provide virtual communities online. Additionally we have a number of special interest groups (SIGs) which meet regularly to discuss and work on specific topics and projects.

ACM@UIC provides computing resources such as servers, software and a working network in our office, accounts for members along with the opportunity to obtain practice maintaining and improving these resources through activities and SIGs. See the Documentation pages and the blog or watch for and attend the General Body Meeting regularly scheduled near the beginning of each semester.
