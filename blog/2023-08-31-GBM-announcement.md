We just wrapped our 2023-24 In-Person Involvement Fair. You can check out the pictures on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/acmatuic/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/acm-cs-uic/). Thank you for showing up and most importantly, welcome to ACM!

We're kicking off the Fall 2023 semester with our 1st GBM of this academic year on **6th September, 5pm, at SELE 2260 (CS Lounge)**.

The GBM will provide a more detailed introduction to ACM and our plans for 2023-24 school year, an info session with Engineering Career Centre and lots of resume making tips & tricks (the Fall Application Cycle is literally HERE). Come for the conversations, food, or both! Check out our GBM Flyer and [RSVP here](https://forms.gle/R4JDYL4d4wCw7DiUA).
