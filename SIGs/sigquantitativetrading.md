## Who are we?

Quantitative Trading Club is a student-based organization at the University of Illinois-Chicago with an emphasis on model algorithmic trading. We learn, utilize, and create models from various open-source, cloud-based programs such as QuantConnect, Quantopian, etc. We backtest, paper-trade, and live-trade our models that are impossible to simulate without the help of financial, computer science, and mathematical literacy.
