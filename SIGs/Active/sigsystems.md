## About

Whether you're new to coding or have some experience, this group is for you!
We'll look at:

- How the Linux operating system works
- How computers do many things at once
- What CPUs actually do
- Moderately sprinkled Rust programming language

This stuff isn't always easy, but it's super cool and will make you a better programmer.

- Helpful for required courses: CS 261, 361

## Recent happenings

We learned some Rust and used that knowledge to build a parser for our shell.

This semester, we’re getting into the (more fun) systems parts of the project!
