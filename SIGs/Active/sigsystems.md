## About

Whether you're new to coding or have some experience, this group is for you! 
We'll look at:
- How the Linux operating system works
- How computers do many things at once
- What CPUs actually do
- Moderately sprinkled Rust programming language

This stuff isn't always easy, but it's super cool and will make you a better programmer. 

- Helpful for required courses: CS 261, 361
