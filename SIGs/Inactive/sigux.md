The main goal for SIG UX is to introduce User Interface Design or improve the UX skills of people interested in the topic. We will discuss UX decisions, skills and the design process to create User Interfaces that truly help the user and fully utilize the capabilities of the program they are designed for.

Throughout the semester we will be critically analyzing existing user interfaces, designing and prototyping new user interfaces, and coding UX solutions into applications that need it.
