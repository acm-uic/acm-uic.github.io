## About

SIG Code is a discussion of a wide variety of languages and code topics. Please feel free to bring any code you find interestingly well written (or badly written) to discuss. Our meetings tend to be general discussion, or themed topic of the week. Bring an open and active mind, and a passion for programming.

This semester we are focusing primary on contributing to open source projects. We will spend the semester learning, analyzing and contributing to code bases in which we fill are in need of an update.

Whether you're a novice or a pro, join us as we make a difference in the open source world.

For past fans of SIG Code, check out [usr/share/dict](https://lug.cs.uic.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=lugcode) , LUG's new programming language exploration group.
