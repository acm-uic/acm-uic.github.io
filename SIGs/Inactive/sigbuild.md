## About

For the 2015-2016 year, we'll be learning about robotics via the design, production, and programming of a UAV in the form of a quadcopter. This will be a continuation from the 2014-2015 year, with the goal of the fall semester being to fully assemble and achieve flight. Throughout the semester we will also do events such as tutorials on soldering and general educational events about working with hardware.

## History

SIG Build began in Fall 2009, when a few rogue ACM members began rummaging through the stray parts lying around the office in order to build working machines. This activity persisted, and eventually snowballed into a full-fledged SIG in Spring 2010.

SIG Build has had a focus on computer hardware (the physical architecture of computing devices and networks) & the software that it interacts with (operating systems, low-level languages, etc., but in recent years expanded to building cool stuff.
